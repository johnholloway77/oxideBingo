# Oxide Bingo

## Purpose

Oxide Bingo is a simple little web app for generating and displaying a collection of randomized
bingo cards for players who listen to the *Oxide and Friends* podcast from Oxide Computers.

This is a silly little thing, not to be taken seriously. It is not made by, supported, nor endorsed
by Oxide Computers. It in no way speaks for Oxide Computer Company.

Game can be played at [https://jholloway.dev/oxidebingo/](https://jholloway.dev/oxidebingo/).
